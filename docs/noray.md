# noray

A fork of Natty for open-source purposes.

## Motivation

While Natty is open-source, its scope becomes quite large from v1 onwards -
managing users, supporting multiple different games, different orchestration
strategies, multiple sessions per user, lobbies, etc. This can make Natty an
unwieldy solution for situations where you just want to get something running
online, or if you don't plan on running a whole platform for some individual
multiplayer games.

This is the niche noray intends to fill - a very simple server that manages
connectivity between players. Anything more than that is the responsibility of
the game or some other backend service unrelated to noray.

Thankfully, at the point of writing, Natty implements most of the features
needed for noray, so it can start its life as a stripped-down fork.

## Scope

To ensure connection, noray will support *NAT punchthrough orchestration* and
*UDP relays*.

A game would happen through the following flow:

- The host connects to noray and sends a host request with its id
  - This id can be whatever, as long as its unique
  - It can be some random-generated string, a player name, a lobby name, etc.
  - It is left to the game itself
  - noray allocates a relay for the host
- Successive clients send a connect request to noray
  - The request contains the host id
- noray sends a handshake message to both parties
  - The host receives the client's external address
  - The client receives the host's external address
- If the handshake succeeds, the client connects to the host
- If the handshake fails, the client sends a relay connect request to noray
  - The client receives the host's relay address to connect to
  - When the client sends data to the host, the client gets its own relay allocated

## Protocol

To keep things simple, data is transmitted through TCP as newline-separated
strings. Each line starts with a command, a space, and the rest of the line is
treated as data. Example:

```
connect-relay host-1
```

The protocol has no concept of replies, threads, correspondences or anything
similar. Think of it as a dumbed-down RPC without return values.
